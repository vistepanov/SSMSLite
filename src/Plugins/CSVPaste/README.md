# Plugin based on CSV Paste
A simple SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) extension for pasting data copied from the Results window as formatted comma-separated values into another query’s IN clause.

## Installing
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Timovski/CSVPaste/releases) and unzip the archive to Management Studio’s extensions folder. There will be a warning message from SSMS the first time it starts. Select “No” and restart SSMS. The extension will work properly from then on. For more information please check the [Installation guide](https://github.com/Timovski/CSVPaste/wiki/Installation-guide).

## How to use
